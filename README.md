# Further improvements

Index.vue
-	Prefetch data on the server instead of using the mount() method
-	Use async await instead of a thenable, this will keep the code clean and easy to read

Components/jokes
-	Remove jokes.styl as it only has one line, it would be better to implement an inline styling rather 
-	jokes.vue: remove unused and commented out code

Api
-	remove certificates from the repository as they shouldnâ€™t be publicly accessible 
-	create a separate repository for the backend 
-	api/mongo.ts: split each database operation to its own classes, this will make the package easy to read and understand.
